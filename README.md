# BBros-Website
This is a website I made for my friends landscaping company.

I was given nothing more then a logo and some text to work with for
the website.  I was instructed to make it simple and professional
for his business.  I worked with him over the phone to design and
develope this website for him business.  It is tested in all major browsers
and it works on mobile, but is not coded mobile first due to
direct request from the client.  At the end of the work myself
and my client are both very happy with the website!
